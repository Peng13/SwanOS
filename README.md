# SwanOS
## Brief introduction
This project is based on BlueNRG-2 plarform. My company wanted to design a Tracker based on this platform. The peripherial devices are consist of A+G sensor, Charger, Key event, Uart communication, and BLE.

How to response these events/tasks in time and in a easy way? I think Operating System is a good choice. 

But... The memory resources are limited in our MCU. So it's not easy to port a exist Real-Time Operating System to our project.

Because of above reasons, I designed a task schedule system on this project. My company name is SwanCom, So I named this os SwanOS.

By the way, this os is still a crude and unshaped thing. I'll keep to optimize and update it.
